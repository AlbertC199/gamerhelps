    <h1>About Me</h1><br>
        <p class="poppins-regular">I am Albert C. and I wanted to make this website as a start to what I would like to happen in the near future when it comes to gaming. What I want is for more people to realize that gaming is more than a distraction and it can be used for more than entertainment. It can be someones career, their safe place, their coping mechanism, and better yet, their highest accomplishment. Gaming has brought millions of people together and some still don't know that it can do some really good things for people. Gaming is a must have in this generation considering peoples preferences and can provode with a lot uses. Mental health is just a good chunk of what gaming can help with. Which is actually the main part of the reason why I made this website. It is just a start to help others that can can help in much more ways than they presume. Gaming to me deserves a lot more praise for what people give it because it gives so many things like a career, stress relief, and education, etc. I think gaming needs more recognition and no, I don't mean it should take over. I just mean to let people play video games how they want to play without being extremely judged or completely hated for how they play. </p><br>
    <h1>Gamerhelps</h1><br>
        <p class="poppins-regular">I created Gamehelps to show the reasons why gaming helps with mental health and can help improve certain skills. And To also, show that gaming can help reduce anger and stress to help not cause problems for the people involved. To help people realize that gaming can make a huge difference all around the board. Especially, when it comes to mental health and how much it can really help calm your illnesses down a bit. Or even help improve your control of them. This website is just a small start of what I really wanted to make. I want to make a website for gamers to help eachother and help grow on their career for gaming. I want to help others grow as a gamer and to help them grow as a person themsleves. Help them grow into the person they want to become and help them be noticed in the gaming world.</p><br>
